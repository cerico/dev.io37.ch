## Why you should use a Makefile

If you have a project or application where you need to run a lot of commands, npm, rake, bin, rails, etc, then you should consider using a Makefile as a front end utility. This has a few advantages:

- You can run multiple commands at once
- All commands are launched with the same command, **`make`**
- All commands are self-documenting

Lets look at an example

```make
tldr:
        @echo Available commands
        @echo ------------------
        @for i in `grep '^[_[:alpha:]]*:' Makefile | awk -F ":" '{print $$1}'`; do echo make $$i; done
install:
        bundle install
        yarn install --check-files
exchange_rates:
        ./bin/rake exchange_rates:refresh
subscription_plans:
        bundle exec rails runner 'SubscriptionPlan.import_all_plans'
generate:
        ./bin/init.js
storybook:
        yarn storybook
```

Here we have a variety of commands that would be launched in different ways. With a Makefile, we can run them all with **`make <command>`**. We can also see all the commands available with **`make tldr`** or just **`make`**. This means any new commands added to the Makefile are automatically caught by the **`make tldr`** command.

## In action

```bash
☁  cericow@kelso:esplanade ➜ make
Available commands
------------------
make tldr
make install
make exchange_rates
make subscription_plans
make generate
make storybook
```

Runnin the **`make`** command picks up the first rule (**`tldr`**) and runs it. The rule greps the file for available rules and lists them out in the format in which they should be run.
