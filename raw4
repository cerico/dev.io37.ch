The output you've provided is the result of running the `_unmerged_commits_across_repos` function in your current directory. This function checks for unmerged commits across multiple repositories located in the current directory and then prints the results.

Here's a breakdown of the output:

- **Repository Name**: Each section starts with the name of a repository (e.g., `cityguessr.com`, `dev.io37.ch`, `fpl`, etc.) in what appears to be cyan color, followed by a separator (`----------------`).

- **Number of Unmerged Commits**: The first column in each section (e.g., `5`, `1`, `4`, etc.) represents the number of commits in the branch that haven't been merged into the default branch of that repository.

- **Commit Age**: The second column (e.g., `14 hours ago`, `10 days ago`, `4 seconds ago`, etc.) indicates how long ago the most recent commit on that branch was made.

- **Commit Message**: The third column provides the message of the most recent commit on that branch.

- **Branch Name**: The fourth column is the name of the branch.

From this output, you can gather several insights:

1. **Multiple Repositories**: You have several repositories in your current directory, and the function has checked each of them for unmerged commits.

2. **Work in Progress**: Many branches have commit messages starting with `wip:`, indicating that they contain work that might still be in progress.

3. **Age of Commits**: Some branches have commits that were made recently (e.g., `4 seconds ago`), while others have commits that are several weeks or months old.

4. **Different Types of Changes**: The commit messages use prefixes like `wip:`, `feat:`, and `fix:` to indicate the type of change made.

If you're managing multiple projects or repositories, this function provides a quick overview of the branches that might need attention, whether that's merging, further development, or cleanup.
